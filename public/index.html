          <p class="left-align light">Legend was born on December 28, 1978, in Springfield, Ohio.[2] He is one of four children[3] of Phyllis Elaine (née Lloyd), a seamstress, and Ronald Lamar Stephens, a factory worker and former National Guardsman.[4][5][6][7] Throughout his childhood, Legend was homeschooled on and off by his mother.[8] At the age of four, he performed with his church choir. He began playing the piano at age seven. At the age of twelve, Legend attended North High School, from which he graduated salutatorian of his class four years later.[9] According to Legend, he was offered admission to Harvard University and scholarships to Georgetown University and Morehouse College.[10] He attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied English with an emphasis on African-American literature.[11]

While in college, Legend served as president and musical director of a co-ed jazz and pop a cappella group called Counterparts.
